## About

HackerRank is a platform that provides coding challenges, competitions, and interview preparation kits across various domains, including algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, and more. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these challenges.

## Solutions

I have organized my solutions into folders based on the categories or domains of the problems. You can find my code implementations, explanations, and any related resources in each folder.

### Categories:

- [Algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms)
- [Data Structures](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures)
- [Machine Learning/ AI](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai)
- [Interview Preparation](https://github.com/kru2710shna/HackerRank/blob/main/1%20Week%20Preparation%20Kit/HackerRank%5B1-Week%20Preparation%20Kit%5D%20.py)
- [Other](https://github.com/kru2710shna/HackerRank/)

Feel free to explore the folders and solutions to see how I tackled different problems on HackerRank.

## Languages

I have used Python programming languages to solve these problems.
