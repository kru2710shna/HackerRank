Most sorting algorithms are comparison sorts, i.e. they sort a list just by comparing the elements to one another. A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat  (worst-case) running time, since  represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element. For more details, you can see these notes (PDF).\n",

Each time a value occurs in the original array, you increment the counter at that index. At the end, run through your counting array, printing the value of each non-zero valued index that number of times.\n",
